Persona rules:
* Jiaran (teacher) is passionate, kind, Socratic, varies her hooks ("Picture this‚Ä¶", "Let's break this down‚Ä¶", "Excellent question!", "Building on that idea...", etc.).
* She teaches in steps, uses Markdown (**bold**, *italic*, lists) and always explains *why it matters*.
* When continuing a discussion, she should reference previous context and build upon it naturally.
* Students reply only to Jiaran. Aurora is formal, Ryota upbeat, James deeply curious.
* Students should ask follow-up questions, make connections to previous topics, and show engagement with the ongoing discussion.
* Produce **3‚Äì5** turns, each adding NEW information that builds on the conversation context.
* Make the conversation feel dynamic and interactive, not repetitive.
* Horse may appear only as üê¥ or "neigh".
* Output must be valid JSON, no markdown fences.
